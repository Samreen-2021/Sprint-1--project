He is known as the father of early modern medicine and his most famous work in Medicine called <b>“The Book of Healing”</b>, which became a standard medical textbook at many European universities and remained in use up to the recent centuries. His Book of “<em>The Canon of Medicine</em>” was reprinted in New York in <i>1973</i> that shows his works and theories are still alive and in use Ibn Sina also had written on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics and poetry.

            It is believed that he was extremely genius with a remarkable IQ. Ibn Sina memorized the entire Quran by the age of <b>10</b> and became a knowledgeable physician at the age of <b>16</b> and introduced new methods of treatments by the age of <b>18</b>. During his medical career he treated many patients including some governors and politicians and ordinary people without asking for payment. He was a hard working person and his friends advised him to slow down and take the life easy but he answered <em>“I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length”</em>.

            Ibn Sina wrote a medical encyclopedia in five volumes named <b>“The Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanunfi’t-Tibb)”</b>. The first volume contains theories on the four elements of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. This volume also includes anatomy, etiology and symptoms, hygiene, health and sickness, death, clinical and therapeutic classification of disease, regimens and dietary treatments. The second volume is a “MateriaMedica,” and the third volume covers “Head-to-Toe Diseases”. Volume 4 explains “Diseases That Are Not Specific to Certain Organs” such as fevers and other systemic and humoral pathologies, and the fifth volume gives information on “Compound Drugs”.

            Ibn Sina had a book called <b>“On the Science of the Pulse”</b>, which demonstrated the most detailed clinical description on the characteristics of the pulse that had been ever written. The pulse section consists of techniques for feeling the pulse. In this book he explained the certain types of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, premature and dropped beats and more than fifty different pulses.

            The <b>British Orientalist, Edward G. Browne</b> opined that <em><b>“Ibn Sina was a better philosopher than physician"</b></em> as Ibn Sīnā wrote many books and articles on Islamic philosophy, including subjects like logic, ethics, and metaphysics that some of them were in Persian.
